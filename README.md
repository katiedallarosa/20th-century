# Analysis of the key events of the 20th century using Python
Acting as a freelance data analyst for the Institute for Public Policy, I'm diving into key events of the 20th century to uncover hidden patterns. My goal: discover the historical relationships between countries in the twentieth century that may influence the current geopolitical climate. Stay tuned for insights that could help confirm the hypothesis that past events have led to the current state of affairs.

## Objective
For this project, I have scraped data from a web page (using Wikipedia), which will be the basis for the visual analysis in the report. The analysis will also involve text mining to uncover textual content. A basic natural language processing (NLP) algorithm has been conducted to the collected data to extract a relationships mapfromit. As a final step, I've created a network analysis visualization for all the content that has been scraped and preprocessed.
## Context
The Institute for Public Policy has employed me to analyze and create a visualization as part of a larger initiative itâ€™s working on. In this scenario, the institute believes that past events heavily influence the current geopolitical climate. To delve deeper into this hypothesis, a clearer understanding of the historical relationships between countries in the twentieth century is needed. My visualization will highlight these past relationships. This way, other researchers can understand and tie my findings into the final report.
## Data Source
The project leverages data scraped from Wikipedia. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.
